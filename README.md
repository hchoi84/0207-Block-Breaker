# 0207-Block-Breaker
Based on Udemy's Unity 2D course. It was a review of me doing the code on my own without monkey see monkey do.

The code can be cleaned up but I decided to continue moving on with tougher challenges.
At my current level, I'll only be copy & pasting codes around different cs files insetad of being able to write more concise codes.

As I'm new to thsi whole GitHub, I have no idea how to change or update the commit title. 
It's actually finished project. 
I got confused with what I'm working on now and accidentally submitted "Implemented Health bar" as the commit title.
